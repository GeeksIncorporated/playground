# Find largest distance
# Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists
# of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes. The goal of the problem is to find largest
# distance between two nodes in a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number
# of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between
# any pair of nodes since it is a tree). The nodes will be
# numbered 0 through N - 1.
#
# The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i]
# and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1,
# it will be root node.
#
#     Example:
#     If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the
#       whole tree looks like this:
#
#           0
#        /  |  \
#       1   2   3
#                \
#                 4
#
#     One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3,
# thus the answer is 3. Note that there are other paths with maximal distance.
